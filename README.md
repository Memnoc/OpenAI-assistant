OpenAI Assistant is a `utility` that allows `newcomers of all kinds` to use `OpenAI APIs` and receive suggestions and naswers to simple and complex issues, posed as questions.

The core of the project is a simple app similar to the [examples](https://beta.openai.com/examples) presented in the official doicumentation, and this particular spin off focuses on `davinci-002` model that helps answering JavaScript coding questions.

I plan on expanding the functionalities of this tool in the future, but for now, I just need an assistant to study :)
